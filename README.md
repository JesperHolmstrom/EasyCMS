Author: Jesper Holmstr√∂m

##Vision

###Problem to solve
A lot of people know how to create simple HTML pages and style them, but it is tedious to manage big sites with a lot of .html documents, especially when changing the layout of the site.
Large CMS's like Wordpress/Joomla can be hard to setup and the user does not need the functionality it offers. A simple lightweight CMS is needed.

###What is EasyCMS?
This projects is intended to be used by people who knows how to create HTML pages but want an easier way of doing so.
After installation it should be quick and easy to edit the website contents through some sort of Admin Panel.
It should be possible to edit the entire sites layout without manually editing every single page of the site.
The CMS should allow for CREATING/READING/UPDATING/DELETING content of the site.
